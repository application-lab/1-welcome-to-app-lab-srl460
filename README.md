Hello! My name is Sylvie and I'm from Mazama, WA. At the moment I am a senior at NYU Shanghai and will be graduating in December. I spend most of my time worrying about the state of our environment and how screwed we are in terms of climate change, but also enjoy drinking coffee, hiking/backpacking, swimming, being outdoors and cooking. I am majoring in Social Science with a focus in Environmental Studies and a minor in Chinese and I hope that it can help me get a job educating communities about sustainability and lessening environmental injustice. 

I'm in the class of 2020, and decided to go to NYU Shanghai on a whim when I was applying for college in 2015/2016. I'm extremely excited to graduate and leave NYU Shanghai. After graduation I have no idea what I'll be doing but will definitely have some downtime in Washington for a little bit to celebrate being done with school. 

##Technology Use - Negatives and Positives
1. I've experienced many positives of living in an information age, in particular increased access to education, ability to contact with people thousands of miles away from ourselves and an ability to research easily. 

2. I've also experienced many many negatives. Cyberbullying, removing yourself from society, depression, anxiety, and many more results of too much time spent on technology analyzing other people's lives instead of focusing on our loved ones and ourselves. Mitigating the impacts of the above are difficult, but in particular I think that setting healthy boundaries for the amount of time that you spend on social media is incredibly important. Spending more than a couple hours a day on your phone is unhealthy, and reminding yourself can help mitigate the problem.
